Working within Data Resolutions Consulting at UCLA, my team and I worked with BruinShack, a small business that works to find affordable housing for UCLA students.

The Client's areas of interest for our team to investigate included:
- SEO strategy, keyword optimization → examining which keywords are popular on sites like Apts.com; what do students look for when looking for housing
- Student Search behavior
- Key listing features
- Competitive Analysis of Apts.com, Zillow, other local competitors
- Comparing Pricing Structures (factors affecting pricing)
- Market share distribution: penetration of properties listed on these sites within Westwood and surrounding areas.
- Estimating the number of properties in Westwood and how they are represented online
- Estimation of properties listed by ownership size if possible (property managers, small landlords, etc.)
- Estimating market penetration → measuring % of college students within the apartment search market	

Within the team I tackled the web-scraping and analyzed the market share distribution in comparison to competitors like Apartments.com
Included is our team's final presentation.
